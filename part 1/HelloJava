   /* On a Unix-like operating system, a single-file source-code application,
   can also be launched as a shebang file like a script. Within the java source file,
    as the first line in the file add:
     path/to/java/home --source <version> like in the exmaple above.

     The file cannot have .java as its file extension, and must also be executable chmod +x. With that,

     it can be launched with:
                              ./HelloJava
