/*The syntax for creating a subclass is simple. At the beginning of your class declaration,
use the extends keyword, followed by the name of the class to inherit from.

This gives MountainBike all the same fields and methods as Bicycle, yet allows its code to focus exclusively
on the features that make it unique. This makes code for your subclasses easy to read. However, you must take
care to properly document the state and behavior that each superclass defines, since that code will not appear
in the source file of each subclass.
